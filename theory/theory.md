Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an expanding, comprehensive, cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. In total, these cloud computing web services deliver a number of distributed computing building blocks and tools together with abstract primitive technical infrastructure. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is one of these services. It provides an opportunity for users to access a virtual cluster of computers at any time they need through the network. AWS's version of virtual computers is responsible for emulating most of a real computer's attributes, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and hardware central processing units (CPUs) for processing, hard-disk/SSD storage, local/RAM memory, networking, a choice of operating systems, and pre-loaded application software, such as customer relationship management (CRM), databases, and web servers.

Storage: Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Block Storage (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Storage Gateway, Snowball, Snowball Edge, Snowmobile.
Database: Aurora, RDS, DynamoDB, ElasticCache, Redshift, Neptune, Database migration service.
Backup Services: Glacier.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service designed by Microsoft and meant for managing, building, testing, and deploying services and applications by Microsoft-managed data centers.
